# SurfaceBook2DX

Surface Book 2 DX (Developer experience).

A place to document my experience developing on a Surface Book 2.

# Why? 
Recently I have been considering switching to using a Mac. I find myself switching between terminal and chrome 90%. From what I understand, the terminal experince on a Mac is much better. I thought it was time to make the switch. I was at a Tech conference and found myself asking a lot of people about their experience using different laptop/OS combos: Macs, Windows, Linux, and even Chrome OS. 

The main takeway: Mac users seem generally unhappy with the current direction of Mac and recent switches to Windows seem suprised by how well it fits into their workflow. I realise that it was not a random sample of the population but I think it's still worth noting.
